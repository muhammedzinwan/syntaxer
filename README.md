## About

Syntaxer is a minimalist, distraction-free tool that helps developers quickly find command syntaxes without having to Google or switch tabs. It stays out of your way until you need it, appearing instantly with a simple keyboard shortcut.

With Syntaxer, you can:
- Type natural language queries (e.g., "How to merge branches in git")
- Get immediate, concise results showing exactly the command you need
- Copy with a single click and get back to coding

No more context switching, no more digging through documentation - just the commands you need, when you need them.

## Features

- üîç **Instant Access**: Global shortcut (Alt+Space) to summon the search bar
- üí¨ **Natural Language**: Ask in plain English how to do something
- üß† **AI-Powered**: Uses Groq for fast api response and Google's Gemini API for intelligent responses
- ‚ö° **Minimal UI**: Distraction-free interface with dark/light theme support
- üìã **Quick Copy**: One-click copying of commands and examples
- üîÑ **System Integration**: System tray icon for easy access
